## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I exported the design from figma and used it as a background to get the elements positioned correctly. instead of thinking top-down about positioning I took the opposite approach and layed out elements using a bottom-up approach.

### Continued development

I signed up for [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) and am following the CSS learning path. I will be completing all the CSS challenges before moving on to JS where I plan to use vanilla JS for the challenges then move on to React, Next and Vue with Nuxt - at which time I plan to employ a CSS framework like Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) - following the CSS learning path has helped me get a grip on the basics of CSS.
